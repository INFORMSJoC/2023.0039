# Data for replication

The ArrivalRates.xlsx file includes the mean arrival rates (in arrivals/hr) for first-time and crisis services across the 18 weeks of the semester. 

The ScheduleProportions.xlsx file includes the optimal schedule proportions for first-time and crisis services across the 18 weeks of the semester, obtained using the methodology proposed in the. paper It includes 18 sheets, with each sheet name in the format {F}-{C}, where {F} represents the average overall first-time service proportion, and {C} represents the average overall crisis service proportion in the schedule. For instance, the sheet "8-4" represents the case when the first-time service proportion is set to 8% and the crisis service proportion is set to 4%. These proportions are used to generate the results in Table 1 and Figure 9 of the paper.

The DPS_Policy.xlsx file includes the scheduling proportions obtained using the DPS policy, shown in Figure 10 and used to generate the results of Figure 11 of the paper.
